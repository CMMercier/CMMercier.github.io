      <description>I recently decided to install and run LLaMA 3, a popular AI model for generating human-like text, on my local machine. As someone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in exploring the capabilities and security of AI, I wanted to experience firsthand how this technology can be used.
Installation The installation process was surprisingly straightforward when using ollama. And it has support for Windows, Linux, and macOS. So first visit https://ollama.com/ and select Download. This just brings us to a page to select the operating system we will be using for the instal.</description>

      <title>Bug Bounty: A tale of credentials listed on phpinfo</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/bb-phpinfo/</link>

      <description>While I am manually going through target websites I always run automated scanning in the background. It rarely finds a real reportable vulnerability and a lot of it is either informational even if it says low or medium or companies tend to run vulnerable versions of software that are patched so the vulnerabilities aren’t exploitable, but I still enjoy looking up what it sees and learning about that specific issue or CVE.</description>

      <title>Bug Bounty: Path Traversal in Snap Creek Duplicator plugin before 1.3.28 for WordPress</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/bb-pathtraversal/</link>

      <description>The Vulnerability The Snap Creek Duplicator plugin before 1.3.28 for WordPress (and Duplicator Pro before 3.8.7.1) allows Directory Traversal via ../ in the file parameter to duplicator_download or duplicator_init.
Intro Early in my bug bounty journey, I picked a few programs from different platforms to learn how they work and respond to reports and to ultimately decide which platform I would choose to stick to.
Knowing that WordPress plugins were often forgotten to update and a good place to find vulnerabilities I focused on finding WordPress vulnerabilities in the wild.</description>

      <description>Recon Initial nmap scan An initial scan with nmap shows that there is two ports open, ssh on 22 and http on 80.
Site Having a look at the page hosted on port 80 there appears to be a host name of Panda.HTB.
Next I added this host to the /etc/hosts/ file with my favorite editor nano. The line added to hosts should look like 10.10.11.136 Panda.HTB. Oddly the same page loads so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing new to see here.</description>

      <description>Intro I have decided to write on my experience at this years HackTheBox CTF event. Apologies for the short writeups. They were taking from the mess of notes and whatever screenshots I had taken to share with the group for discussion. I didn’t plan ahead to write a post about it after so learning better note keeping is definitely going on the list!
Kryptos Support For this task we were simply given a page saying “Report any issues regarding the Kryptos Vault below” and an input field similar to a reporting system where after submission the admin checks our report.</description>

      <title>Bug Bounty: How to get private invites</title>

      <description>Now I know that a lot of people will not like this answer and you certainly do not have to follow this method if you don’t wish to.
But the answer is:
Vulnerability Disclosure Programs
These programs are generally frowned upon by the majority of skilled hackers as they do not pay anything for valid vulnerabilities. Since they are overlooked however, it is the easiest and fastest way to finding high ranking and valid vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>One Month Bug Bounty Journey Update</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/onemonthbb/</guid>
      <description>Introduction My goal with this is to explain some of my thoughts and how they changed as I progressed and how I modified my path along the way. For we will always be learning in the field of Cybersecurity and there is no race to a finish line just finding the most time efficient path to learn as much as we can as we go. Lastly I want to mention when you feel like you are struggling and seeing everyone’s accomplishments on social media is getting you down, remember that they too struggled.</description>

      <title>Beginner Bug Bounty Journey</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/beginnerbb/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I began my journey with all the many resources out there both free and paid that are centered on training you to become a penetration tester. The main resources I found to be the best for learning were TryHackMe and the Practical Ethical Hacking course by TCM Academy. The problem I learned mostly by following the major community leaders in Youtube, LinkedIn and Twitter, is that there are already far more people wanting to be penetration testers than there are open roles for them to fill.</description>

      <title>HTB: Writeup — Forge</title>

      <description>Recon Using Rustscan and Nmap came back with different results. We can’t really do anything with the filtered port but it’s nice to know that it is there. I wasn’t able to find a way to make Rustscan discover this filtered port that Nmap had so I may default back to using nmap. Or just keep trying them both out like I have been.
So here we have 3 open ports.</description>

      <description>Introduction Kasm Workspaces are delivered through Docker containers and is mainly aimed at small businesses looking to reduce platform resource requirements and increase security especially in this work from home space we have been moving into. But this software can easily have many personal uses with its disposable browsers and desktops. Options to host Kasm Workspaces include on-premise, in the cloud, or they even have the option to host it for you.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/openwrt/</guid>
      <description>Introduction So back when Raspberry Pi was super hyped I really wanted one. I always loved to play with tech and there was so much that could be done with such a handy small and inexpensive device.
So eventually and very excitedly I purchased the Raspberry Pi 3 when I had some extra cash to do so. But after an extensive search of existing Pi project lists, personal sites, and Youtube videos, I wasn’t really able to find many project or project ideas that actually interested me or felt worthy.</description>

      <description>Firstly, I want to give credit to Heath Adams at TCM Security. The Practical Ethical Hacking course helped me learn more than any book and the hands on learning was just what I needed!

      <description>Setup For this I visited https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop and looked through the many options to get my own personal instance of Juice Shop setup. The first option, Deploy on Heroku for free, caught my eye. For this I simply had to:
Sign up to Heroku and log in. Click the provided deploy button. This really is the fastest and simplest way to get setup, and its free!
After I clicked deploy I had to give the app a name and wait for it to build.</description>

      <description>Create a Repository Firstly you&amp;rsquo;ll want to create a repository for this on Github to make changes easier to update with git commit and push rather than uploading files manually every time you make changes. As this will be a Github Page you will want to name the repo as &amp;lsquo;.github.io&amp;rsquo;. Yes the .io here is important so make sure you add that.
Clone this repository to your local machine and cd to it, I added mine under the users documents folder.</description>
