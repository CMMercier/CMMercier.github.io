This really is the fastest and simplest way to get setup, and its free!\nAfter I clicked deploy I had to give the app a name and wait for it to build. Really the longest part of this was waiting for it to build.

I remembered it existed but not where and forgot that it was actually a part of the challenges so I took to google and did a quick search for its location.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/#/score-board\nFirst challenge complete: Score Board (Find the carefully hidden \u0026lsquo;Score Board\u0026rsquo; page.)\nBonus Payload Category: XSS\nThis challenge is as simple as adding the provided payload to the search function.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Bonus Payload (Use the bonus payload \u0026lt;iframe width=\u0026quot;100%\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;166\u0026quot; scrolling=\u0026quot;no\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;no\u0026quot; allow=\u0026quot;autoplay\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076\u0026amp;color=%23ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=true\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show _comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026amp;show_teaser=true\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; in the DOM XSS challenge.)\nBully Chatbot Category: Miscellaneous\nTo access the Chatbot I created a new account on the site then opened up the menu and selected the support chat. I really just had to send any message containing the words \u0026ldquo;coupon code\u0026rdquo; enough times for it to give up and hand over a code.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Bully Chatbot (Receive a coupon code from the support chatbot.)\nConfidential Document Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\nThe hints:\n Somewhere in the application you can find a file that contains sensitive information about some - potentially hostile - takeovers the Juice Shop top management has planned.\n  -Analyze and tamper with links in the application that deliver a file directly.\n  -The file you are looking for is not protected in any way. Once you found it you can also access it.\n In the About Us section I found a link \u0026ldquo;Check out our boring terms of use if you are interested in such lame stuff.\u0026rdquo; that opened up a download window to get a legal.md document. I opened up burp suite and intercepted this request there and noticed the GET request was to a ftp server.\nSo I checked to see if something simple like https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/ftp would work and it did!\nDOM XSS Category: XSS\n Perform a DOM XSS attack with \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;javascript:alert(xss)\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.\n This is another task where I was able to simply just copy the script provided and paste it into the search function to complete this challenge.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: DOM XSS (Perform a DOM XSS attack with \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;javascript:alert(xss)\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.)\nError Handling Category: Security Misconfiguration\n Provoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled.\n This one has so many ways to trigger it that I ended up completing it and didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice.\nExposed Metrics Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\n Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system.\n The hints pretty much give this one away. A quick read through and the name of this challenge made it obvious that the path I was looking for was /metrics/.\n Guessing the path is probably just as quick as taking the RTFM route via https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps\n You successfully solved a challenge: Exposed Metrics (Find the endpoint that serves usage data to be scraped by a popular monitoring system.)\nMissing Encoding Category: Improper Input Validation\n Retrieve the photo of Bjoern\u0026rsquo;s cat in \u0026ldquo;melee combat-mode\u0026rdquo;.\n Luckily this was as easy as url encoding the #\u0026rsquo;s to %23 because that emoji really had me scratching my head for a bit there.\nhttps://www.eso.org/~ndelmott/url_encode.html\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Missing Encoding (Retrieve the photo of Bjoern\u0026rsquo;s cat in \u0026ldquo;melee combat-mode\u0026rdquo;.)\nOutdated Allowlist Category: Unvalidated Redirects\nFor the reading: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\n Let us redirect you to one of our crypto currency addresses which are not promoted any longer.\n For this one I inspected the page to open the debugger window so that I could have a look around the Javascript files to try to find the crypto currency address. The first place I checked was main-es2018.js and I simply did a search for redirect which had 20 results to check through but the answer was there and I simply had to paste this blockchain.info link to the app address.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/redirect?to=https://blockchain.info/address/1AbKfgvw9psQ41NbLi8kufDQTezwG8DRZm\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Outdated Allowlist (Let us redirect you to one of our crypto currency addresses which are not promoted any longer.)\nPrivacy Policy Category: Miscellaneous\n Read our privacy policy.\n This simply required me to be logged in and go to Account \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026amp; Security \u0026gt; Privacy Policy.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Privacy Policy (Read our privacy policy.)\nRepetitive Registration Category: Improper Input Validation\n Follow the DRY principle while registering a user.\n    The DRY (Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) Principle states:\n  Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\n This challenge required me to turn on burp and foxyproxy to catch a legit registration attempt and change the value of passwordRepeat then forward the request.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Repetitive Registration (Follow the DRY principle while registering a user.)\nZero Stars Category: Improper Input Validation\n Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store.\n Reading: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\nI found the customer feedback option as the first option on the menu. This page allows us to give a feedback of 1 to 5. Getting around this is as simple as intercepting the request in burp and changing the rating to 0.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Zero Stars (Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store.)\n2 * Challenges Admin Section Category: Broken Access Control\n Access the administration section of the store.\n The quick and easy first check was to try to guess the admin page location. I tried https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/#/admin but no luck there so I tried administration instead and got a 403 You are not allowed to access this page!. Also turns out you can find this path from the main.js as well if guessing failed.\nI have found the page but I still need to login as the administrator to complete this challege. Going to the login page I see that we need the administrators email not username to login. So I go back and look through the shop looking for the complete email address somewhere or at least an @email to just have to guess the name.\nOn the review for the product Apple Juice contains a review from the admin themselves!\nadmin@juice-sh.op\nThe category for this challenge is injection but there\u0026rsquo;s another challenge to log in without using injection so its time to brute force the login page instead and complete both challenges in one go. I first attempted this with hydra but soon discovered that hydra is does not work because this is a client-side AngularJS route. So its time to try with burp! I captured the request and sent it over to intruder. I set the position to the password and on payload options I loaded a smaller file from seclist called best1050.txt as I only have the free version of burp and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t load rockyou. Running this attack on the free version is a bit slow but it works and I get the password.\nThis completes two challenges:\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Login Admin (Log in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user account.)\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Password Strength (Log in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.)\nNow to just login with the credentials admin@juice-sh.op:admin123 and head over to the previously found /#/administration page to complete this challenge.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Admin Section (Access the administration section of the store.)\nDeprecated Interface Category: Security Misconfiguration\n Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down.\n For this I had to do some googling to understand what B2B integration was about and came across this explanation \u0026ldquo;It allows them to work and trade more effectively with their customers, suppliers and business partners by automating key business processes.\u0026rdquo; from www.ibm.com. So I headed over to the complaint page on the menu and took a look at what file types were accepted which turned out to be .pdf and .zip files. Inspecting this and heading back to debugger to take a look at the main-es2018.js and doing a search for zip revealed that .xml was also accepted.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have any random .xml files around so I used touch test.xml to create one and then selected browse on the site and chose all file types so that I could select this file and upload it.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Deprecated Interface (Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down.)\nFive-Star Feedback Category: Broken Access Control\n Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback.\n Sounds like an admin task, so I headed back to the administration page to take a look and sure enough the customer feedback section was there with only one 5-star feedback. All I had to do was hit delete on this one and the challenge completed.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Five-Star Feedback (Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback.)\nLogin Admin Category: Injection\n Log in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user account.\n See Admin Section challenge solve.\nAnother method is with injection like the category suggests. Log in with Email ' or 1=1-- and any Password which will authenticate the first entry in the Users table which usually happens to be the administrator.\nLogin MC SafeSearch Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\n Log in with MC SafeSearch\u0026rsquo;s original user credentials without applying SQL Injection or any other bypass.\n The hints for this supply a link to a video by MC SafeSearch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59CX2DiX0Y called \u0026ldquo;Protect Ya' Passwordz\u0026rdquo;. Watch this video to learn that MC used the name of his dog \u0026ldquo;Mr. Noodles\u0026rdquo; as a password but changed \u0026ldquo;some vowels into zeroes\u0026rdquo;.\nAll I had to do was log in with email mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op, as we already know what email addresses look like for this site and could easily guess the name, and password Mr. N00dles to solve this challenge.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Login MC SafeSearch (Log in with MC SafeSearch\u0026rsquo;s original user credentials without applying SQL Injection or any other bypass.)\nMeta Geo Stalking Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\n Determine the answer to John\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of him to the Photo Wall and use it to reset his password via the Forgot Password mechanism.\n The title hints toward geo data so I headed over to the photo wall and downloaded the picture by jOhNny. I then ran exiftool to get the GPS coordinates.\nAnd then did a google search of these coordinates to find a name that could be the security question.\nIt took quite a few attempts but I eventually found it to be Daniel Boone National Forest and was able to login by going to \u0026ldquo;forgot your password?\u0026rdquo; and using john@juice-sh.op for the email, Daniel Boone National Forest for the security question, and resetting the password.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Meta Geo Stalking (Determine the answer to John\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of him to the Photo Wall and use it to reset his password via the Forgot Password mechanism.)\nPassword Strength Category: Broken Authentication\n Log in with the administrator\u0026rsquo;s user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.\n See Admin Section challenge solve.\nSecurity Policy Category: Miscellaneous\n Behave like any \u0026ldquo;white-hat\u0026rdquo; should before getting into the action.\n For this I attempted to run gobuster and dirbuster against the site to no success. So I loaded up OWASP\u0026rsquo;s very own ZAP and was able to find a file at https://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/.well-known/security.txt. I went to that address and the challenge completed but out of curiosity I looked up what this file was about anyway and heres the link for reference: https://securitytxt.org/.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Security Policy (Behave like any \u0026ldquo;white-hat\u0026rdquo; should before getting into the action.)\nView Basket Category: Broken Access Control\n View another user\u0026rsquo;s shopping basket.\n I headed over to the main page and added an item to the basket then selected the basket. On the basket page I inspected the page and went to the session storage where I found the item total and bid. Bid must hold the user id value so I changed the 1 to 2 and reloaded the page to complete the challenge.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: View Basket (View another user\u0026rsquo;s shopping basket.)\nVisual Geo Stalking Category: Sensitive Data Exposure\n Determine the answer to Emma\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of her to the Photo Wall and use it to reset her password via the Forgot Password mechanism.\n At first I attempted a reverse image search on google but saw quickly that that was not the way to go with this. Looking closer at the image itself I noticed the ITsec logo in a window on the left side.\nUsing this (case sensitive) as the security question I was able to reset her password and complete the challenge.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Visual Geo Stalking (Determine the answer to Emma\u0026rsquo;s security question by looking at an upload of her to the Photo Wall and use it to reset her password via the Forgot Password mechanism.)\nWeird Crypto Category: Cryptographic Issues\n Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does.\n When completing the Meta Geo Stalking challenge I got a password hash back in the response from the burp request. Using hash-identifier I found out that this has is only an unsalted MD5. Taking this hash to crackstation.net easily got me the password of john@juice-sh.op as test1234.\nThe challenge says to inform the shop about the algorithm so to complete this challenge I had to go to Customer Feedback on the menu and simply leave a comment that said MD5 and solve the captcha to submit.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Weird Crypto (Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does.)\nReflected XSS Unavailable on the Heroku environment.\n3 * Challenges Privacy Policy Inspection Category: Security through Obscurity\n Prove that you actually read our privacy policy.\n Going to Account \u0026gt; Privacy and Security \u0026gt; Privacy Policy didn\u0026rsquo;t immediately complete this task so I started having a look around and noticed some areas highlight. So I inspected one of these areas to find a class=\u0026quot;hot\u0026quot;. There seems to be a code hidden here that starts with the site address, We may also, instruct you, to refuse all, reasonably necessary and responsibility.\nhttps://exampleapp.herokuapp.com/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility\nGoing to this greets us with a 404 Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/app/frontend/dist/frontend/assets/private/thank-you.jpg'\nAnd going back to the scoreboard I see the challenge has indeed completed.\nYou successfully solved a challenge: Privacy Policy Inspection (Prove that you actually read our privacy policy.)\n ","date":"September 19, 2021","hero":"/posts/owasp-juice-shop-walkthrough/hero.jpg","permalink":"/posts/owasp-juice-shop-walkthrough/","summary":"Setup For this I visited https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/bkimminich/juice-shop and looked through the many options to get my own personal instance of Juice Shop setup.
